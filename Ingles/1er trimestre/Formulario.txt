Family
There are five people i my family.
I've got twosisters, an older one and a younger one.
When I'm with my family, I enjoy chatting about our life and having lunch together.

Home
I live in a hause.
It's got three bedrooms, a living room, a big yard in the back withlots of plants and space for my pets and a kitchen-dining room wwhere we spend most of our time.
I live in a town called Fuente Vaqueros. The area where I live is very noisy and dirty, but, it has it's good things, for example, we have the house-museum of Federico García Lorca, a great literary that lived here before
he died and left us with nothing more than his literary works like "La Tarara", "Los cuatro muleros" and more. Fuente Vaqueros even have its own music band, and we play for lots of special events, like Federico García Lorca day, 
Santa Cecilia day, the town festives, or even in processions from all arround Andalucía.

Leisure time
I listen to all kind of music since all music have its own mood and give a totally different vibe than other genere.
I'm a big fan of Mägo de Oz, I love their songs, but specialy, "Te traeré el horizonte" and "La costa del silencio".
At the weekend, I ussually play some tabletop games with my friends and talk with my family about our week.
I enjoy playing ESports, LoL more specifically, a videogame that is considered an electronic sport since it can be really competitive.
I often go to a field that is close to my house and have a good day with my sisters, my father and my dogs.

Studies
My favourite subject is programming, it is a very fun class where I find what I want to learn since I already know the things that the teacher is explaining now.
I've been learning english for 10 years in school and secondary school.
This year I'm studying for my final exam.
